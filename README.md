# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills using Spark, Google Colab, and Big Data information. 
- Data was extracted from Amazon Web Services S3 Buckets into a Google Colab Notebook, transformed using PySpark, and then loaded into a PostgreSQL database.

## Project Overview
- Key concepts on "Big Data" were introduced, including Spark, Hadoop, Amazon Web Servies (AWS), and MapReduce.
- Google Colab Notebooks were used to utilize Spark dataframes and functions. 
- The Natural Language Processing pipeline was introduced, including the process to tokenize data, stop words, and term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting.


### Challenge Overview
- A large dataset was extracted from an AWS bucket through an AWS RDS instance. The data was then transformed and loaded into a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin 4.
- Using PySpark, queries were executed to determine the number of reviews, number of 5 star reviews, and percentage of 5 star revies for Vine reviewers and non-Vine reviewers.
- That information was then used to determine if there is any bias in the reviews from Vine members.
